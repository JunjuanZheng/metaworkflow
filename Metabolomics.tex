\hypertarget{introduction}{%
\chapter{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Information in living organism commuicates along the Central Dogma in different scales from individual, population, community to ecosystem. Metabolomics (i.e., the profiling and quantitation of metabolites) is a relatively new field of ``omics'' studies. Different from other omics studies, metabolomics always focused on small moleculars with much lower mass than polypeptide with single or doubled charged ions. Here is a demo of the position of metabolomics in ``omics'' studies\citep{b.dunn2011}.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{images/metaintro} \caption{The complex interactions of functional levels in biological systems.}\label{fig:metaintro}
\end{figure}

Metabolomics studies always employ GC-MS\citep{theodoridis2012}, GC*GC-MS\citep{tian2016}, LC-MS\citep{gika2014}, LC-MS/MS\citep{begou2017} or NMR\citep{zhang2012a, b.dunn2011} to measure metabolites. However, this workflow will only cover mass spectrometry based metabolomics or XC-MS based research.

\hypertarget{defination}{%
\subsection{Defination}\label{defination}}

Metabolomics is actually a comprehensive analysis with identification and quantification of both known and unknown compounds in an unbiased way. Metabolic fingerprinting is working on fast classification of samples based on metabolite data without quantifying or identification of the metabolites. Metabolite profiling always need a pre-defined metabolites list to be quantification\citep{madsen2010}. However, targeted and untargeted metabolomics are also used in publicaitons. A similar concept called non-targeted analysis/screen is actually describe the similar studies or workflow.

\hypertarget{experimental-designdoe}{%
\chapter{Experimental design(DoE)}\label{experimental-designdoe}}

Before you perform any metabolomics studies, a clean and meaningful experimental design is the best start. Depending on different research purposes, experiental design can be classified into homogeneity and heterogeneity study. Technique such as isotope labeled media will not be discussed in this chapter while this paper\citep{jang2018} could be a good start.

\hypertarget{homogeneity-study}{%
\section{Homogeneity study}\label{homogeneity-study}}

In homogeneity study, the research purpose is about method validation in most cases. Pooled sample made from multiple samples or technical replicates from same population will be used. Variances within the samples should be attibuted to factors other than the samples themselves. For example, one wants to test if sample injection order will affect the intensities of the unknown peaks. One pooled sample or technical replicates samples could be used here and the variances of the intensities should not be designed from heterogenety samples.

Another experimental design for homogeneity study will use biological replicates to find the common feasures from a group of samples. Biological replicates mean samples from same populatio with same biological process. For example, we wanted to know metabolites profiles of a certain species and we could collected lots of the individual samples from the same species. Then only the peaks/compounds appeared in all samples will be used to describe the metabolites profiles of this species. Technical replicates could also be used with biological replicates.

\hypertarget{heterogeneity-study}{%
\section{Heterogeneity study}\label{heterogeneity-study}}

In heterogeneity study, the research purpose is to find the differents among samples. To get the heterogeneity, you need at least a baseline to perform the comparision. Such baseline could be generated by random process or control samples or background knowledge. For example, outlier detection can be performed to find abnormal samples in unsupervised manners. Distribution or spatial analysis could be used to find geological relationship of known and unknown compounds. Temporal trend of metabolites profile could be found by time series or cohort studies. Clinical trial or random control trial is also an important class of heterogeneity studies. In this cases, you need at least two groups: treated group and control group. Also you could treat this group infomation as the one primary variable or primary variables to be explored for certain research purposes. In the following discussion about experimental design, we will use random control trail as model to discuss important issues.

\hypertarget{sample-size}{%
\section{Sample size}\label{sample-size}}

Supporsing we have control and treated groups, the numbers of samples in each group should be carefully calculated.For each metabolite, such comparision could be treated as one t-test. You need to perform a Power analysis to get the numbers. For example, we have two groups of samples with 10 samples in each group. Then we set the power at 0.9, which means one minus Type II error probability, the standard deviation at 1 and the significance level(Type 1 error probability) at 0.05. Then we get the meanful delta between the two groups should be higher than 1.53367 under this experiment design. Also we could set the delta to get the minimized numbers of the samples in each group. To get those data such as the standard deviation or delta for power analysis, you need to perform prelimitary or pilot experiments.

\begin{Shaded}

##           delta = 5
##              sd = 1
##       sig.level = 0.05
##           power = 0.9
##     alternative = two.sided
## 
## NOTE: n is number in *each* group
\end{verbatim}

However, since sometimes we could not perform preliminary experiment, we could directly compute the power based on false discovery rate control. If the power is lower than certain value, say 0.8, we just exclude this peak as significant features. In this review \citep{oberg2009}, author suggest to estimate an average \(\alpha\) according to this equation \citep{benjamini1995} and then use normal way to calculate the sample numbers:

\[
\alpha_{ave} \leq (1-\beta_{ave})\cdot q\frac{1}{1+(1-q)\cdot m_0/m_1}
\]

Other study \citep{blaise2016a} show a method based on simulation to estimate the sample size. They used BY correction to limit the influences from correlations. However, the nature of omics study make the power analysis hard to use one numbers for all metabolites and all the methods are trying to find a balance to represent more peaks with least samples(save money).

If there are other co-factors, a linear model or randomizing would be applied to eliminated their influences. You need to record the values of those co-factors for further data analysis. Common co-factors in metabolomics studies are age, gender, location, etc.

If you need data correction, some background or calibration samples are required. However, control samples could also be used for data correction in certain DoE.

Another important factors are instrumentals. High-resolution mass spectrum is always preferred. As shown in Lukas's study \citep{najdekr2016}:

\begin{quote}
the most effective mass resolving powers for profiling analyses of metabolite rich biofluids on the Orbitrap Elite were around 60000--120000 fwhm to retrieve the highest amount of information. The region between 400--800 m/z was influenced the most by resolution.
\end{quote}

However, elimination of peaks with high RSD\% within group were always omited by most study. Based on pre-experiment, you could get a description of RSD\% distribution and set cut-off to use stable peaks for further data analysis. To my knowledge, 50\% is suitable considering the batch effects.

\hypertarget{pretreatment}{%
\chapter{Pretreatment}\label{pretreatment}}

Pretreatment will affect the results of metabolomics and cover the sample treatment from crude samples to injection vials. Sample pretreatment try to retain more interesting compounds while remove unrelated compounds. For metabolomics studies, we might not know `interesting' compounds in advance and the unrelated compounds are highly depended on research purpose. For example, Gel Permeation Chromatograph(GPC), Florisil, Alumina, Silica gel could be used to remove lipid while alcohols and strong acid/base could make protein denaturation to release more compounds. However, if we are interested in lipid or protein, such pretreatment methods should be changed. In general, sample quenching, extraction methods, derivatization, and storage should be optimized in pretreatment.

\hypertarget{quenching}{%
\section{Quenching}\label{quenching}}

Quenching solvent is always used to stop stop enzymatic activity.

In this review\citep{lu2017}, authors said:

\begin{quote}
A classical approach, which works well for many analytes, is boiling ethanol. Although the boiling solvent raises concerns about thermal degradation, it reliably denatures enzymes. In contrast, cold organic solvent may not fully denature enzymes or may do so too slowly such that some metabolic reactions continue, interconverting metabolites during the quenching process.
\end{quote}

This review\citep{kim2020} summarised the urease-dependent metabolome sample preparation and found:

\begin{quote}
activities of urease and endogenous urinary enzymes and metabolite contaminants from the urease preparations introduce artefacts into metabolite profiles, thus leading to misinterpretation.
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{extraction}{%
\section{Extraction}\label{extraction}}

According to this research\citep{bennett2009}:

\begin{quote}
The total metabolome concentration is approximately 300 mM, whereas the protein concentration is approximately 7 mM., which implies that most cellular metabolites are in free form.
\end{quote}

Dmitri et.al\citep{sitnikov2016} thought the most orthogonal methods to methanol-based precipitation were ion-exchange solid-phase extraction and liquid-liquid extraction using methyl-tertbutyl ether.

Tissue samples need to first be pulverized into fine powders.

Feces collected with 95\% ethanol or FOBT would be more reproducible and stable.

In this review\citep{lu2017}, authors said:

\begin{quote}
In our experience, for both cell and tissue specimens, 40:40:20 acetonitrile:methanol:water with 0.1 M formic acid (and subsequent neutralization with ammonium bicarbonate) is generally an effective solvent system for both quenching and extraction, including for ATP and other high-energy phosphorylated compounds. We typically use approximately 1 mL of solvent mix to extract 25 mg of biological specimen. \ldots Thus, although drying is acceptable for most metabolites, care must be taken with redox-active species.
\end{quote}

\citep{luo2017a} nano LC-MS could be used to analysis small numbers of cells.

For plant like soybeans\citep{mahmud2017}, ammonium acetate/methanol could be selected as extraction strategies compared with water/methanol and sodium phosphate/methanol.

\hypertarget{derivatization}{%
\section{Derivatization}\label{derivatization}}

Derivatization is always used in GC-based metabolomics study. This paper\citep{miyagawa2019} compared sequential derivatization methods and found different compounds would show different fluctuations during oximation or silylation process.

\hypertarget{storage}{%
\section{Storage}\label{storage}}

Samples should be stored after sample collection or sample pretreatment. -80°C or -20°C is always preferred to store samples. Dry ice should be used during sample pretreatment. However, comprehensive investigation of storage influnces found the metabolites profile will change after one day storage at -80°C. Rapid analysis of samples should be considered to capture more accurate information in the samples.

\hypertarget{instrumental-analysis}{%
\chapter{Instrumental analysis}\label{instrumental-analysis}}

To get more infomation in the samples, full scan is perferred on GC/LC-MS. Each scan would generat a mass spectrum to cover the setting mass range. If you narrow down your mass range and keep the same scan time, each mass would gain the collection time and you would get a higher sensitivity. However, if you expand your scan range, the sensitivity for each mass would decrease. You could also extend the collection time for each scan. However, it would affect the seperation process.

Full scan is performed synchronously with the seperation process. For a better seperation on chromotograph, each peak should have at least 10 point to get a nice peak shape. If you want to seperate two peaks with a retention time differences of 10s. Assuming the half peak width is 5s, you need to collect 10 mass spectrum within 10s. So the drwell time for each scan is 1s. If you use a high resolution column and the half peak width is 1s, you need to finish a scan within 0.2s. As we talked above, shorter drwell time would decrease the sensitivity. Thus there is a trade-off between seperation and sensitivity. If you use UPLC, the seperation could be finished within 20 min while you need to calculate if you mass spectrumetry could still show a good sensitivity.

\hypertarget{column-and-gradient-selection}{%
\section{Column and gradient selection}\label{column-and-gradient-selection}}

For GC, higher temperature could release compounds with higher boiling point. For LC, gradient and functional groups of stationary phase would be more important than temperature. Polarity of samples and column should match. More polar solvent could release polar compounds. Normal-phase column will not retain non-polar compounds while reversed-phase will elute polar column in the very beginning. To cover a wide polarity range or logP value compounds, normal phase column should match with non-polar to polar gradient to get a better seperation of polar compounds while reverse phase column should match with polar to non-polar gradient to elute compounds. If you use a inappropricate order of gradient, you compounds would not be seperated well. If you have no idea about column and gradient selection, literature's condiation might help.

\hypertarget{pooled-qc-samples}{%
\section{Pooled QC samples}\label{pooled-qc-samples}}

Pooled QC samples are unique and very important for metabolomics study. Every 10 or 20 samples, a pooled sample from all samples and blank sample in one study should be injected as quality control samples. Pooled QC samples contain the changes during the instrumental analysis and blank samples could tell where the variances come from. Meanwhile the cap of sequence should old the column with pooled QC samples. The injection sequence should be randomized. Those papers\citep{dunn2012, broadhurst2018} should be read for details.

\hypertarget{mass-resolution}{%
\section{Mass resolution}\label{mass-resolution}}

For metabolomics, high resolution mass spectrum should be used to make identification of compounds easier. The Mass Resolving Power is very important for annotation and high resolution mass spectrum should be calibrated in real time. The region between 400--800 m/z was influenced the most by resolution\citep{najdekr2016}. Orbitrap Fusion's performance was evaluated here\citep{barbiersainthilaire2018}.

\hypertarget{raw-data-pretreatment}{%
\chapter{Raw data pretreatment}\label{raw-data-pretreatment}}

Raw data from the instruments such as LC-MS or GC-MS were hard to be analyzed. To make it clear, the structure of those data could be summarised as:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Indexed scan with time-stamp
\item
  Each scan contains a full scan mass spectra
\end{itemize}

Commen formats for open source mass spectrum data are mzxml, mzml or CDF. However, \textbf{masscomp} might shrink the data size\citep{yang2019b}.

\hypertarget{data-visualization}{%
\section{Data visualization}\label{data-visualization}}

You could use \href{https://salsa.debian.org/debichem-team/msxpertsuite}{msxpertsuite} for MS data visualization. It is biological mass spectrometry data visualization and mining with full JavaScript ability\citep{rusconi2019}.

\hypertarget{peak-extraction}{%
\section{Peak extraction}\label{peak-extraction}}

GC/LC-MS data are usually be shown as a matrix with column standing for retention times and row standing for masses after bin them into small cell.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{images/singledata} \caption{Demo of GC/LC-MS data}\label{fig:singledata}
\end{figure}

Conversation from the mass-retention time matrix into a vector with selected MS peaks at certain retention time is the basic idea of Peak extraction. You could EIC for each mass to charge ratio and use the change of trace slope to determine whether there is a peak or not. Then we could make integration for this peak and get peak area and retention time.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{Metabolomics_files/figure-latex/demoeic-1.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:demoeic}Demo of EIC with peak}
\end{figure}

However, due to the accuracy of instrument, the detected mass to charge ratio would have some shift and EIC would fail if different scan get the intensity from different mass to charge ratio.

In the \texttt{matchedfilter} algorithm\citep{smith2006}, they solve this issue by bin the data in m/z dimension. The adjacent chromatographic slices could be combined to find a clean signal fitting fixed second-derivative Gaussian with full width at half-maximum
(fwhm) of 30s to find peaks with about 1.5-4 times the signal peak width. The the integration is performed on the fitted area.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{images/matchedfilter} \caption{Demo of matchedfilter}\label{fig:matchedfilter}
\end{figure}

The \texttt{Centwave} algorithm\citep{tautenhahn2008} based on detection of regions of interest(ROI) and the following Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) is preferred for high-resolution mass spectrum. ROI means a regine with stable mass for a certain time. When we find the ROIs, the peak shape is evaluated and ROI could be extended if needed. This algotithm use \texttt{prefilter} to accelerate the processing speed. \texttt{prefilter} with 3 and 100 means the ROI should contain 3 scan with intensity above 100. Centwave use a peak width range which should be checked on pool QC. Another important parameter is \texttt{ppm}. It is the maximum allowed deviation between scans when locating regions of interest (ROIs), which is different from vendor number and you need to extend them larger than the company claimed. For \texttt{profparam}, it's used for fill peaks or align peaks instead of peak picking. \texttt{snthr} is the cutoff of signal to noise ratio.

\hypertarget{retention-time-correction}{%
\section{Retention Time Correction}\label{retention-time-correction}}

For single file, we could get peaks. However, we should make the peaks align across samples for subsquece analysis and retention time corrections should be performed. The basic idea behind retention time correction is that use the high quality grouped peaks to make a new retention time. You might choose \texttt{obiwarp}(for dramatic shifts) or loess regression(fast) method to get the corrected retention time for all of the samples. Remember the original retention times might be changed and you might need cross-correct the data. After the correction, you could group the peaks again for a better cross-sample peaks list. However, if you directly use \texttt{obiwarp}, you don't have to group peaks before correction.

\citep{fu2017} show a matlab based shift correction methods.

\hypertarget{filling-missing-values}{%
\section{Filling missing values}\label{filling-missing-values}}

Too many zeros or NA in peaks list are problematic for statistics. Then we usually need to integreate the area exsiting a peak. \texttt{xcms\ 3} could use profile matrix to fill the blank. They also have function to impute the NA data by replace missing values with a proportion of the row minimum or random numbers based on the row minimum. It depends on the user to select imputation methods as well as control the minimum fraction of featuers appeared in single group.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{images/peakfiling} \caption{Peak filling of GC/LC-MS data}\label{fig:peakfilling}
\end{figure}

With many groups of samples, you will get another data matrix with column standing for peaks at cerntain retention time and row standing for samples after the Raw data pretreatment.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{images/multidata} \caption{Demo of many GC/LC-MS data}\label{fig:multidata}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{spectral-deconvolution}{%
\section{Spectral deconvolution}\label{spectral-deconvolution}}

Without fracmental infomation about certain compound, the peak extraction would suffer influnces from other compounds. At the same retention time, co-elute compounds might share similar mass. Hard electron ionization methods such as electron impact ionization (EI), APPI suffer this issue. So it would be hard to distighuish the co-elute peaks' origin and deconvolution method\citep{du2013} could be used to seperate different groups according to the similar chromatogragh beheviors. Another computational tool \textbf{eRah} could be a better solution for the whole process\citep{domingo-almenara2016}. Also the \textbf{ADAD-GC3.0} could also be helpful for such issue\citep{ni2016}.

\hypertarget{dynamic-range}{%
\section{Dynamic Range}\label{dynamic-range}}

Another issue is the Dynamic Range. For metabolomics, peaks could be below the detection limit or over the detection limit. Such Dynamic range issues might raise the loss of information.

\hypertarget{non-detects}{%
\subsection{Non-detects}\label{non-detects}}

Some of the data were limited by the detect of limitation. Thus we need some methods to impute the data if we don't want to lose information by deleting the NA or 0.

Two major imputation way could be used. The first way is use model-free method such as half the minimum of the values across the data, 0, 1, mean/median across the data( \texttt{enviGCMS} package could do this via \texttt{getimputation} function). The second way is use model-based method such as linear model, random forest, KNN, PCA. Try \texttt{simputation} package for various imputation methods. As mentioned before, you could also use \texttt{imputeRowMin} or \texttt{imputeRowMinRand} within \texttt{xcms} package to perform imputation.

Tobit regression is preferred for censored data. Also you might choose maximum likelihood estimation(Estimation of mean and standard deviation by MLE. Creating 10 complete samples. Pool the results from 10 individual analyses).

According to Ronald Hites's simulation\citep{hites2019}, measurements below the LOD (even missing measurements) with the LOD/2 or with the \(LOD/\sqrt2\) causes little bias and ``Any time you have a \% non-detected \textgreater20\%, for whatever reason, it is unlikely that the data set can give useful results.''

As shown in {[}Exprimental design(DoE){]}, the power analysis in metabolomics is ad-hoc since you don't know too much before you perform the experiment. However, we could perform power analysis after the experiment done. That is, we just rule out the peaks with a lower power in exsit Exprimental design.

\includegraphics[width=0.618\linewidth]{Metabolomics_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-10-1}

\section{post hoc data normalization}\label{post-hoc-data-normalization}}

To make the samples comparable, normailization across the samples are always needed when the experiment part is done. Batch effect should have patterns, otherwise just noise. Correction is possible by data analysis/randomized experimental design. There are more than 20 methods to make normalization. We could devided those methods into two category: unsupervised and supervised.

Unsupervised methods only consider the normalization peaks intensity distribution across the samples. For example, quantile calibration try to make the intensity distribution among the samples similar. Such methods are preferred to explore the inner structures of the samples. Internal standards or pool QC samples also belong to this category. However, it's hard to take a few peaks standing for all peaks extracted.

Supervised methods will use the group information or batch information in experimental design to normalize the data. A linear model is always used to model the unwanted variances and remove them for further analysis.

Since the real batch effects are always unknown, it's hard to make validation for different normalization methods. Wu et.al preferred to make comparision between new methods and conventional methods\citep{wu2016}. Li et.al developed NOREVA to make comparision among 25 correction method\citep{li2017a}. Another idea is use spiked-in samples to validate the methods\citep{franceschi2012}, which might be good for targeted analysis instead of non-targeted analysis.

Relative log abundance (RLA) plots\citep{delivera2012} and heatmap often used to show the variances among the samples.

\hypertarget{surrogate-variable-analysissva}{%
\subsubsection{Surrogate Variable Analysis(SVA)}\label{surrogate-variable-analysissva}}

We have a data matrix(M*N) with M stands for indentity peaks from one sample and N stand for individual samples. For one sample, \(X = (x_{i1},...,x_{in})^T\) stands for the normalized intensities of peaks. We use \(Y = (y_i,...,y_m)^T\) stands for the group infomation of our data. Then we could build such modles:

\[x_{ij} = \mu_i + f_i(y_i) + e_{ij}\]

\(\mu_i\) stands for the baseline of the peak intensities in a normal state. Then we have:

\[f_i(y_i) = E(x_{ij}|y_j) - \mu_i\]

stands for the biological variations caused by the our group, for example, whether treated by pollutions or not.

However, considering the batch effects, the real model could be:

\[x_{ij} = \mu_i + f_i(y_i) + \sum_{l = 1}^L \gamma_{li}p_{lj} + e_{ij}^*\]
\(\gamma_{li}\) stands for the peak-specific coefficient for potentical factor \(l\). \(p_{lj}\) stands for the potential factors across the samples. Actually, the error item \(e_{ij}\) in real sample could always be decomposed as \(e_{ij} = \sum_{l = 1}^L \gamma_{li}p_{lj} + e_{ij}^*\) with \(e_{ij}^*\) standing for the real random error in certain sample for certain peak.

We could not get the potential factors directly. Since we don't care the details of the unknown factors, we could estimate orthogonal vectors \(h_k\) standing for such potential factors. Thus we have:

\[
x_{ij} = \mu_i + f_i(y_i) + \sum_{l = 1}^L \gamma_{li}p_{lj} + e_{ij}^*\\ 
= \mu_i + f_i(y_i) + \sum_{k = 1}^K \lambda_{ki}h_{kj} + e_{ij}
\]

Here is the details of the algorithm:

\hypertarget{detection-of-unmodeled-factors}{%
\paragraph{Detection of unmodeled factors}\label{detection-of-unmodeled-factors}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Estimate \(\hat\mu_i\) and \(f_i\) by fitting the model \(x_{ij} = \mu_i + f_i(y_i) + e_{ij}\) and get the residual \(r_{ij} = x_{ij}-\hat\mu_i - \hat f_i(y_i)\). Then we have the residual matrix R.
\item
  Perform the singular value decompositon(SVD) of the residual matrix \(R = UDV^T\)
\item
  Let \(d_l\) be the \(l\)th eigenvalue of the diagonal matrix D for \(l = 1,...,n\). Set \(df\) as the freedom of the model \(\hat\mu_i + \hat f_i(y_i)\). We could build a statistic \(T_k\) as:
\end{itemize}

\[T_k = \frac{d_k^2}{\sum_{l=1}^{n-df}d_l^2}\]

to show the variance explained by the \(k\)th eigenvalue.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Permute each row of R to remove the structure in the matrix and get \(R^*\).
\item
  Fit the model \(r_{ij}^* = \mu_i^* + f_i^*(y_i) + e^*_{ij}\) and get \(r_{ij}^0 = r^*_{ij}-\hat\mu^*_i - \hat f^*_i(y_i)\) as a null matrix \(R_0\)
\item
  Perform the singular value decompositon(SVD) of the residual matrix \(R_0 = U_0D_0V_0^T\)
\item
  Compute the null statistic:
\end{itemize}

\[
T_k^0 = \frac{d_{0k}^2}{\sum_{l=1}^{n-df}d_{0l}^2}
\]

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Repeat permuting the row B times to get the null statistics \(T_k^{0b}\)
\item
  Get the p-value for eigengene:
\end{itemize}

\[p_k = \frac{\#{T_k^{0b}\geq T_k;b=1,...,B }}{B}\]

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  For a significance level \(\alpha\), treat k as a significant signature of residual R if \(p_k\leq\alpha\)
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{construction-of-surrogate-variables}{%

\begin{itemize}
\item

\item
  Perform the singular value decompositon(SVD) of the residual matrix \(R = UDV^T\). Let \(e_k = (e_{k1},...,e_{kn})^T\) be the \(k\)th column of V
\item
  Set \(\hat K\) as the significant eigenvalues found by the first step.
\item
  Regress each \(e_k\) on \(x_i\), get the p-value for the association.
\item
  Set \(\pi_0\) as the proportion of the peak intensitity \(x_i\) not associate with \(e_k\) and find the numbers \(\hat m =[1-\hat \pi_0 \times m]\) and the indices of the peaks associated with the eigenvalues
\item
  Form the matrix \(\hat m_1 \times N\), this matrix\(X_r\) stand for the potiential variables. As was done for R, get the eigengents of \(X_r\) and denote these by \(e_j^r\)
\item
  Let \(j^* = argmax_{1\leq j \leq n}cor(e_k,e_j^r)\) and set \(\hat h_k=e_j^r\). Set the estimate of the surrogate variable to be the eigenvalue of the reduced matrix most correlated with the corresponding residual eigenvalue. Since the reduced matrix is enriched for peaks associated with this residual eigenvalue, this is a principled choice for the estimated surrogate variable that allows for correlation with the primary variable.
\item
  Employ the \(\mu_i + f_i(y_i) + \sum_{k = 1}^K \gamma_{ki}\hat h_{kj} + e_{ij}\) as te estimate of the ideal model \(\mu_i + f_i(y_i) + \sum_{k = 1}^K \gamma_{ki}h_{kj} + e_{ij}\)
\end{itemize}

This method could found the potentical unwanted variables for the data. SVA were introduced by Jeff Leek\citep{leek2012, leek2007, leek2008} and EigenMS package implement SVA with modifications including analysis of data with missing values that are typical in LC-MS experiments\citep{karpievitch2014a}.

\hypertarget{ruv-remove-unwanted-variation}{%
\subsubsection{RUV (Remove Unwanted Variation)}\label{ruv-remove-unwanted-variation}}

This method's performance is similar to SVA. Instead find surrogate variable from the whole dataset. RUA use control or pool QC to find the unwanted variances and remove them to find the peaks related to experimental design. However, we could also empirically estimate the control peaks by linear mixed model. RUA-random\citep{livera2015} furthor use linear mixed model to estimate the variances of random error. This method could be used with suitable control, which is commen in metabolomics DoE.

\hypertarget{rrmix}{%
\subsubsection{RRmix}\label{rrmix}}

RRmix also use a latent factor models correct the data\citep{jr2017}. This method could be treated as linear mixed model version SVA. No control samples are required and the unwanted variances could be removed by factor analysis. This method might be the best choise to remove the unwanted variables with commen experiment design.

\hypertarget{annotation}{%
\chapter{Annotation}\label{annotation}}

When you get the peaks table or features table, annotation of the peaks would help you. Check this review\citep{domingo-almenara2018} for a detailed notes on annotation. They proposed five levels regarding currently computational annotation strategies.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Level 1: Peak Grouping: MS Psedospectra extraction based on peak shape similarity and peak abundance correlation
\item
  Level 2: Peak Annotation: Adducts, Neutral losses, isotopes, and other mass relationships based on mass distances
\item
  Level 3: Biochemical knowledge based on putative identification, potential biochemical reaction and related statistical analysis
\item
  Level 4: Use and intergration of tandem MS data based on data dependant/independent acquistion mode or \textbf{in silico} predction
\item
  Level 5: Retention time prediction based on library-available retention index or quantitative structure-retnetion relationships (QSRR) models.
\end{itemize}

Most of the softwares are at level 1 or 2. If we only have compounds structure, we could guess ions under different ionization method. If we have mass spectrum, we could match the mass spectral by a similarity analysis to the database. In metabolomics, we only have mass spectrum or mass-to-charge ratios. Single mass-to-charge ratio is not enough for identification. That's the one bottleneck for annotation. So prediction is always performed on MS/MS data.

\hypertarget{issues-in-annotation}{%
\section{Issues in annotation}\label{issues-in-annotation}}

The major issue in annotation is the redundancy peaks from same metabolite. Unlike genomcis, peaks or featuers from peak selection are not independant with each other. Adducts, in-source fragments and isotopes would lead to missannotation. A commen solution is that use known adducts, neutral losses, molecular multimers or multipley charged ions to compare mass distances.

Another issue is about the MS/MS database. Only 10\% of known metabolites in databases have experimental spectral data. Thus \textbf{in silico} prediction are required. Some works try to fill the gap between experimental data, theoretical values(from chemical database like chemspider) and prediction together. Here is a nice review about MS/MS prediction\citep{hufsky2014}.

According to the defination from the Chemical Analysis Working Group of the Metabolomics Standards Intitvative\citep{sumner2007, viant2017}. Four levels of confidence could be assigned to identification:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Level 1 `identified metabolites'
\item
  Level 2 `Putatively annotated compounds'
\item
  Level 3 `Putatively characterised compound classes'
\item
  Level 4 `Unknown'
\end{itemize}

In practice, data analysis based annotation could reach level 2. For level 1, we need at extra methods such as MS/MS, retention time, accurate mass, 2D NMR spectra, and so on to confirm the compounds. However, standards are always required for solid proof.

\hypertarget{common-analysis-methods-for-metabolomics}{%
\chapter{Common analysis methods for metabolomics}\label{common-analysis-methods-for-metabolomics}}

The general purposes for metabolomics study are strongly associated with research goal. However, since metabolomics are usually performed in a non-targeted mode, statistical analysis methods are always started with the exploratory analysis. The basic target for an exploratory analysis is:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Find the relationship among variables
\item
  Find the relationship among samples/group of samples.
\end{itemize}

This is basically unsurpvised analysis.

However, sometimes we have group information which could be used to find biomarkers or correlationship between variables and groups or continous variables. This type of data need supervised methods to process. Before we talk the details of algorithms, let's cover some basic statistical concepts.

\hypertarget{basic-statistical-analysis}{%
\section{Basic Statistical Analysis}\label{basic-statistical-analysis}}

\textbf{Statistic} is used to describe certain property or variables among the samples. It could be designed for certain purpose to extract signal and remove noise. Statistical models and inference are both based on statistic instead of the data.

\[Statistic = f(sample_1,sample_2,...,sample_n)\]

\textbf{Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST)} is often used to make statistical inference. P value is the probability of certain statistics happens under H0 (pre-defined distribution).

For omics studies, you should realise \textbf{Multiple Comparision} issue when you perform a lot of(more than 20) comparisions or tests at the same time. \textbf{False Discovery Rate(FDR) control} is required for multiple tests to make sure the results are not false positive. You could use Benjamini-Hochberg method to adjust raw p values or directly use Storey Q value to make FDR control.

NHST is famous for the failure of p-value interpretation as well as multiple comparision issues. \textbf{Bayesian Hypothesis Testing} could be an options to cover some drawbacks of NHST. Bayesian Hypothesis Testing use Bayes factor to show the differences between null hypothesis and any other hypothesis.

\[Bayes\ factor = \frac{p(D|Ha)}{p(D|H0)} = \frac{posterior\ odds}{prior\ odds}\]

\textbf{Statistical model} use statistics to make prediction/explanation. Most of the statistical model need to be tuned for parpameters to show a better performance. Statistical model is build on real data and could be diagnosed by other general statistics such as \(R^2\), \(ROC curve\). When the models are built or compared, model selection could be preformed.

\[Target = g(Statistic) = g(f(sample_1,sample_2,...,sample_n))\]

\textbf{Bias-Variance Tradeoff} is an important concept regarding statistical models. Certain models could be overfitted(small Bias, large variance) or underfitted(large Bias, small variance) when the parameters of models are not well selected.

\[E[(y - \hat f)^2] = \sigma^2 + Var[\hat f] + Bias[\hat f]\]

\textbf{Cross validation} could be used to find the best model based on training-testing strategy such as Jacknife, bootstraping resampling and n-fold cross validation.

\textbf{Regularization} for models could also be used to find the model with best prediction performance. Rigid regression, LASSO or other general regularization could be employed to build a robust models.

For supervised models, linear model and tree based model are two basic categories. \textbf{Linear model} could be useful to tell the independant or correlated relationship of variables and the influnces on the predicted variables. \textbf{Tree based model}, on the other hand, try to build a hierarchical structure for the variables such as bagging, random forest or boosting. Linear model could be treated as special case of tree based model with single layer. Other models like Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) or Deep Learning are also make various assumptions on the data. However, if you final target is prediction, you could try any of those models or even weighted combine their prediciton to make meta-prediction.

\hypertarget{differences-analysis}{%
\section{Differences analysis}\label{differences-analysis}}

After we get corrected peaks across samples, the next step is to find the differences between two groups. Actually, you could perform ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis Test for comparison among more than two groups. The basic idea behind statistic analysis is to find the meaningful differences between groups and extract such ions or peak groups.

So how to find the differences? In most metabolomics software, such task is completed by a t-test and report p-value and fold changes. If you only compare two groups on one peaks, that's OK. However, if you compare two groups on thousands of peaks, statistic textbook would tell you to notice the false positive. For one comparasion, the confidence level is 0.05, which means 5\% chances to get false positive result. For two comparasions, such chances would be \(1-0.95^2\). For 10 comparasions, such chances would be \(1-0.95^{10} = 0.4012631\). For 100 comparasions, such chances would be \(1-0.95^{100} = 0.9940795\). You would almost certainly to make mistakes for your results.

In statistics, the false discovery rate(FDR) control is always mentioned in omics studies for mutiple tests. I suggested using q-values to control FDR. If q-value is less than 0.05, we should expect a lower than 5\% chances we make the wrong selections for all of the comparisions showed lower q-values in the whole dataset. Also we could use local false discovery rate, which showed the FDR for certain peaks. However, such values are hard to be estimated accurately.

Karin Ortmayr thought fold change might be better than p-values to find the differences\citep{ortmayr2016a}.

\hypertarget{t-test-or-anova}{%
\subsection{T-test or ANOVA}\label{t-test-or-anova}}

If one peak show significant differences among two groups or multiple groups, T-test or ANOVA could be used to find such peaks. However, when multiple hypothesis testings are performed, the probability of false positive would increase. In this case, false discovery rate(FDR) control is required. Q value or adjusted p value could be used in this situation. At certain confidence interval, we could find peaks with significant differences after FDR control.

\hypertarget{limma}{%
\subsection{LIMMA}\label{limma}}

Linear Models for MicroArray Data(LIMMA) model could also be used for high-dimensional data like metabolomics. They use a moderated t-statistic to make estimation of the effects called Empirical Bayes Statistics for Differential Expression. It is a hierarchical model to shrink the t-statistic for each peak to all the peaks. Such estimation is more robust. In LIMMA, we could add the known batch effect variable as a covariance in the model. LIMMA is different from t-test or ANOVA while we could still use p value and FDR control on LIMMA results.

\hypertarget{bayesian-mixture-model}{%
\subsection{Bayesian mixture model}\label{bayesian-mixture-model}}

Another way to make difference analysis is based on Bayesian mixture model without p value. Such model would not use hypothesis testing and directly generate the posterior estimation of parameters. A posterior probability could be used to check whether certain peaks could be related to different condition. If we want to make comparison between classical model like LIMMA and Bayesian mixture model. We need to use simulation to find the cutoff.

\hypertarget{pca}{%
\section{PCA}\label{pca}}

In most cases, PCA is used as an exploratory data analysis(EDA) method. In most of those most cases, PCA is just served as visualization method. I mean, when I need to visualize some high-dimension data, I would use PCA.

So, the basic idea behind PCA is compression. When you have 100 samples with concentrations of certain compound, you could plot the concentrations with samples' ID. However, if you have 100 compounds to be analyzed, it would by hard to show the relationship between the samples. Actually, you need to show a matrix with sample and compounds (100 * 100 with the concentrations filled into the matrix) in an informal way.

The PCA would say: OK, guys, I could convert your data into only 100 * 2 matrix with the loss of information minimized. Yeah, that is what the mathematical guys or computer programmer do. You just run the command of PCA. The new two ``compounds'' might have the cor-relationship between the original 100 compounds and retain the variances between them. After such projection, you would see the compressed relationship between the 100 samples. If some samples' data are similar, they would be projected together in new two ``compounds'' plot. That is why PCA could be used for cluster and the new ``compounds'' could be referred as principal components(PCs).

However, you might ask why only two new compounds could finished such task. I have to say, two PCs are just good for visualization. In most cases, we need to collect PCs standing for more than 80\% variances in our data if you want to recovery the data with PCs. If each compound have no relationship between each other, the PCs are still those 100 compounds. So you have found a property of the PCs: PCs are orthogonal between each other.

Another issue is how to find the relationship between the compounds. We could use PCA to find the relationship between samples. However, we could also extract the influences of the compounds on certain PCs. You might find many compounds showed the same loading on the first PC. That means the concentrations pattern between the compounds are looked similar. So PCA could also be used to explore the relationship between the compounds.

OK, next time you might recall PCA when you need it instead of other paper showed them.

Besides, there are some other usage of PCA. Loadings are actually correlation coefficients between peaks and their PC scores. Yamamoto et.al.\citep{yamamoto2014} used t-test on this correlation coefficient and thought the peaks with statistically significant correlation to the PC score have biological meanings for further study such as annotation. However, such analysis works better when few PCs could explain most of the variances in the datasets.

\hypertarget{cluster-analysis}{%
\section{Cluster Analysis}\label{cluster-analysis}}

After we got a lot of samples and analyzed the concentrations of many compounds in them, we may ask about the relationship between the samples. You might have the sampling information such as the date and the position and you could use boxplot or violin plot to explore the relationships among those categorical variables. However, you could also use the data to find some potential relationship.

But how? if two samples' data were almost the same, we might think those samples were from the same potential group. On the other hand, how do we define the ``same'' in the data?

Cluster analysis told us that just define a ``distances'' to measure the similarity between samples. Mathematically, such distances would be shown in many different manners such as the sum of the absolute values of the differences between samples.

For example, we analyzed the amounts of compound A, B and C in two samples and get the results:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}llll@{}}
\toprule
Compounds(ng) & A & B & C\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endhead
Sample 1 & 10 & 13 & 21\tabularnewline
Sample 2 & 54 & 23 & 16\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

The distance could be:

\[
distance = |10-54|+|13-23|+|21-16| = 59
\]

Also you could use the sum of squares or other way to stand for the similarity. After you defined a ``distance'', you could get the distances between all of pairs for your samples. If two samples' distance was the smallest, put them together as one group. Then calculate the distances again to combine the small group into big group until all of the samples were include in one group. Then draw a dendrogram for those process.

The following issue is that how to cluster samples? You might set a cut-off and directly get the group from the dendrogram. However, sometimes you were ordered to cluster the samples into certain numbers of groups such as three. In such situation, you need K means cluster analysis.

The basic idea behind the K means is that generate three virtual samples and calculate the distances between those three virtual samples and all of the other samples. There would be three values for each samples. Choose the smallest values and class that sample into this group. Then your samples were classified into three groups. You need to calculate the center of those three groups and get three new virtual samples. Repeat such process until the group members unchanged and you get your samples classified.

OK, the basic idea behind the cluster analysis could be summarized as define the distances, set your cut-off and find the group. By this way, you might show potential relationships among samples.

\hypertarget{plsda}{%
\section{PLSDA}\label{plsda}}

PLS-DA, OPLS-DA and HPSO-OPLS-DA\citep{yang2017a} could be used.

Partial least squares discriminant analysis(PLSDA) was first used in the 1990s. However, Partial least squares(PLS) was proposed in the 1960s by Hermann Wold. Principal components analysis produces the weight matrix reflecting the covariance structure between the variables, while partial least squares produces the weight matrix reflecting the covariance structure between the variables and classes. After rotation by weight matrix, the new variables would contain relationship with classes.

The classification performance of PLSDA is identical to linear discriminant analysis(LDA) if class sizes are balanced, or the columns are adjusted according to the mean of the class mean. If the number of variables exceeds the number of samples, LDA can be performed on the principal components. Quadratic discriminant analysis(QDA) could model nonlinearity relationship between variables while PLSDA is better for collinear variables. However, as a classifier, there is little advantage for PLSDA. The advantages of PLSDA is that this modle could show relationship between variables, which is not the goal of regular classifier.

Different algorithms\citep{andersson2009} for PLSDA would show different score, while PCA always show the same score with fixed algorithm. For PCA, both new variables and classes are orthognal. However, for PLS(Wold), only new classes are orthognal. For PLS(Martens), only new variables are orthognal. This paper show the details of using such methods\citep{brereton2018}.

Sparse PLS discriminant analysis(sPLS-DA) make a L1 penal on the variable selection to remove the influnces from unrelated variables, which make sense for high-throughput omics data\citep{lecao2011}.

For o-PLS-DA, s-plot could be used to find features.\citep{wiklund2008}

Here is a list for related open source \href{http://strimmerlab.org/notes/mass-spectrometry.html}{projects}

\hypertarget{xcms-online}{%
\subsection{XCMS online}\label{xcms-online}}

\href{https://xcmsonline.scripps.edu/landing_page.php?pgcontent=mainPage}{XCMS online} is hosted by Scripps Institute. If your datasets are not large, XCMS online would be the best option for you. Recently they updated the online version to support more functions for systems biology. They use metlin and iso metlin to annotate the MS/MS data. Pathway analysis is also supported. Besides, to accelerate the process, xcms online employed stream (windows only). You could use stream to connect your instrument workstation to their server and process the data along with the data acquisition automate. They also developed apps for xcms online, but I think apps for slack would be even cooler to control the data processing.

\hypertarget{prime}{%
\subsection{PRIMe}\label{prime}}

\href{http://prime.psc.riken.jp/Metabolomics_Software/}{PRIMe} is from RIKEN and UC Davis. They update their database frequently\citep{tsugawa2016}. It supports mzML and major MS vendor formats. They defined own file format ABF and eco-system for omics studies. The software are updated almost everyday. You could use MS-DIAL for untargeted analysis and MRMOROBS for targeted analysis. For annotation, they developed MS-FINDER and statistic tools with excel. This platform could replaced the dear software from company and well prepared for MS/MS data analysis and lipidomics. They are open source, work on Windows and also could run within mathmamtics. However, they don't cover pathway analysis. Another feature is they always show the most recently spectral records from public repositories. You could always get the updated MSP spectra files for your own data analysis.

If you make GC-MS based metabolomics, this paper\citep{matsuo2017} could be nice start.

\hypertarget{openms}{%
\subsection{OpenMS}\label{openms}}

\href{https://www.openms.de/}{OpenMS} is another good platform for mass spectrum data analysis developed with C++. You could use them as plugin of \href{https://www.knime.org/}{KNIME}. I suggest anyone who want to be a data scientist to get familiar with platform like KNIME because they supplied various API for different programme language, which is easy to use and show every steps for others. Also TOPPView in OpenMS could be the best software to visualize the MS data. You could always use the metabolomics workflow to train starter about details in data processing. pyOpenMS and OpenSWATH are also used in this platform. If you want to turn into industry, this platform fit you best because you might get a clear idea about solution and workflow.

\hypertarget{mzmine-2}{%
\subsection{MZmine 2}\label{mzmine-2}}

\href{http://mzmine.github.io/}{MZmine 2} has three version developed on Java platform and the lastest version is included into \href{https://msdk.github.io/}{MSDK}. Similar function could be found from MZmine 2 as shown in XCMS online. However, MZmine 2 do not have pathway analysis. You could use metaboanalyst for that purpose. Actually, you could go into MSDK to find similar function supplied by \href{http://www.proteosuite.org}{ProteoSuite} and \href{https://www.openchrom.net/}{Openchrom}. If you are a experienced coder for Java, you should start here.

\hypertarget{xcms}{%
\subsection{XCMS}\label{xcms}}

\href{https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/xcms.html}{xcms} is different from xcms online while they might share the same code. I used it almost every data to run local metabolomics data analysis. Recently, they will change their version to xcms 3 with major update for object class. Their data format would integrate into the MSnbase package and the parameters would be easy to set up for each step. Normally, I will use msconvert-IPO-xcms-xMSannotator-metaboanalyst as workflow to process the offline data. It could accelerate the process by parallel processing. However, if you are not familiar with R, you would better to choose some software above.

\hypertarget{emory-mahpic}{%
\subsection{Emory MaHPIC}\label{emory-mahpic}}

This platform is composed by several R packages from Emory University including \href{https://sourceforge.net/projects/aplcms/}{apLCMS} to collect the data, \href{https://sourceforge.net/projects/xmsanalyzer/}{xMSanalyzer} to handle automated pipeline for large-scale, non-targeted metabolomics data, \href{https://sourceforge.net/projects/xmsannotator/}{xMSannotator} for annotation of LC-MS data and \href{https://code.google.com/archive/p/atcg/wikis/mummichog_for_metabolomics.wiki}{Mummichog} for pathway and network analysis for high-throughput metabolomics. This platform would be preferred by someone from environmental science to study exposome. I always use xMSannotator to annotate the LC-MS data.

\hypertarget{dia-data-analysis}{%
\subsection{DIA data analysis}\label{dia-data-analysis}}

\href{https://skyline.ms/project/home/software/Skyline/begin.view}{Skyline} is a freely-available and open source Windows client application for building Selected Reaction Monitoring (SRM) / Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM), Parallel Reaction Monitoring (PRM - Targeted MS/MS), Data Independent Acquisition (DIA/SWATH) and targeted DDA with MS1 quantitative methods and analyzing the resulting mass spectrometer data.

\href{https://github.com/MeenaChoi/MSstats}{MSstats} is an R-based/Bioconductor package for statistical relative quantification of peptides and proteins in mass spectrometry-based proteomic experiments. It is applicable to multiple types of sample preparation, including label-free workflows, workflows that use stable isotope labeled reference proteins and peptides, and work-flows that use fractionation. It is applicable to targeted Selected Reactin Monitoring(SRM), Data-Dependent Acquisiton(DDA or shotgun), and Data-Independent Acquisition(DIA or SWATH-MS). This github page is for sharing source and testing.

MS-DAIL is also an option for DIA.

I suggest building your data analysis projects in RStudio(Click File - New project - New dictionary - Empty project). Then assign a name for your project. I also recommend the following tips if you are familiar with it.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Use \href{https://git-scm.com/}{git}/\href{https://github.com/}{github} to make version control of your code and sync your project online.
\item
  Don't use your name for your project because other peoples might cooperate with you and someone might check your data when you publish your papers. Each project should be a work for one paper or one chapter in your thesis.
\item
  Use \textbf{workflow} document(txt or doc) in your project to record all of the steps and code you performed for this project. Treat this document as digital version of your experiment notebook
\item
  Use \textbf{data} folder in your project folder for the raw data and the results you get in data analysis
\item
  Use \textbf{figure} folder in your project folder for the figure
\item
  Use \textbf{munuscript} folder in your project folder for the manuscript (you could write paper in rstudio with the help of template in \href{https://github.com/rstudio/rticles}{Rmarkdown})
\item
  Just double click \textbf{{[}yourprojectname{]}.Rproj} to start your project
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{data-input}{%
\section{Data input}\label{data-input}}

\textbf{xcms} does not support all of the raw files formate from every mass spectrometry. You need to convert your raw data into some open-source \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry_data_format}{data format} such as mzData, mzXML or CDF files. The tool is \textbf{MSconvert} from \href{http://proteowizard.sourceforge.net/}{\textbf{ProteoWizard}}.

\hypertarget{peak-picking-1}{%
\subsection{Peak picking}\label{peak-picking-1}}

The first step to process the MS data is that find the peaks against the noises. In \textbf{xcms}, all of related staffs are handled by \emph{xcmsSet} function.

For any functions in \textbf{xcms} or \textbf{R}, you could get their documents by type \texttt{?} before certain function. Another geek way is input the name of the function in the console of Rstudio and press F1 for help.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{?xcmsSet}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

In the document of \emph{xcmsset}, we could set the sample classes, profmethod, profparam, polarity,etc. In the online version, such configurations are shown in certain windows. In the local analysis environment, such parameters are setup by yourselves. However, I think the default configurations could satisfied most of the analysis because related information should have been recorded in your Raw data and \textbf{xcms} could find them. All you need to do is that show the data dictionary for \emph{xcmsSet}.

If your data have many groups such as control and treated group, just put them in separate subfolder of the data folder and \emph{xcmsSet} would read them as separated groups.

\hypertarget{data-correction}{%
\subsection{Data correction}\label{data-correction}}

Reasons of data correction might come from many aspects such as the unstable instrument and pollution on column. In \textbf{xcms}, the most important correction is retention time correction. Remember the original retention time might changed and use another object to save the new object.

\hypertarget{peaks-filling}{%
\subsection{Peaks filling}\label{peaks-filling}}

After the retention time correction, filling the missing peaks could be done by \emph{fillpeaks}. Peaks filling could avoid two many NAs for false statistical analysis. The algorithm could use the baseline signal to impute the data.

\hypertarget{peaks-list}{%
\section{Peaks list}\label{peaks-list}}

Then we could extract the peaks list from \texttt{xcmsSet} objects.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{peaks-filtering}{%
\section{Peaks filtering}\label{peaks-filtering}}

After we get the peaks list, it's nessary to filter the peaks list to retain the peaks with high quality for further analysis. Normally, we could use the relative standard deviation of blank and pooled QC samples to control the peaks list.

\hypertarget{exposome}{%
\chapter{Exposome}\label{exposome}}

Nature or nurture debate has a similar paradigm in environmental study: is the ecological system and human health risk dominated by heredity or environment? Twins and siblings study\citep{lakhani2019, polderman2015} show that both heritability and environmental factors could explain the phenotypic variance among population. The contribution of environment among different disease functional domain such as hematological and endocrine could achieve almost half of the total variances \citep{polderman2015}. However, besides those epidemiology proof, little is known about the influences of overall environmental exposure process at molecular level. Conventional exposure study always investigate one or several specific compounds and their environmental fate or toxicology endpoint. Exposome, on the other hand, tries to access multiple exposure factors from biological or environmental samples as much as possible without a predefined compounds list. Those endogenous and exogenous molecules can reveal the exposure process in details. Exposome could not only help to investigate the comprehensive molecules level changes, but also the interactions among molecules in an non-targeted design. By following annotation of captured compounds, exposome can discover exposure markers for certain type of pollution, as well as biomarkers for certain exposure process and discuss related physiological process.

According to \href{https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/exposome/default.html}{CDC}, The exposome can be defined as the measure of all the exposures of an individual in a lifetime and how those exposures relate to health. Exposomics is the study of the exposome and relies on the application of internal and external exposure assessment methods.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Internal exposure relies on fields of study such as genomics, metabolomics, lipidomics, transcriptomics and proteomics.
\item
  External exposure assessment relies on measuring environmental stressors.

LogP is important for analytical chemistry. Mannhold \citep{mannhold2009} report a comprehensive comparison of logP algorithms. Later, \href{http://blog.rguha.net/?p=896}{Rajarshi Guha} make a comparison with logP algorithms with CDK based on logPstar dataset. Commercial software such as Spark, ACS Labs and ChemAxon might always claim a better performance on in-house dataset compared with public software like KowWIN within EPI Suite. However, we should be careful to evaluate the influnce of logP accuracy on the metabolites or unknown compounds.
